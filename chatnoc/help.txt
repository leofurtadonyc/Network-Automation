Overview:
----------
ChatNOC is an interactive shell that allows you to query and manage your network devices
using natural language. It leverages an LLM (Ollama running run llama3.1:8b) to interpret your 
queries and connects to your devices via SSH in normal mode to execute commands.

ChatNOC is modular and supports:
  - Default mode that understands your network and interact with network devices.
  - **Demo Mode** for safe, dry-run experimentation with pre-saved command outputs.
  - **General Mode** for open-ended networking topics (no device commands executed).
  - Detailed explanations and health checks based on baseline configurations.

Usage:
------
At the prompt, type your query in plain English. You can use multiple languages (e.g., Brazilian Portuguese).
Here are some examples:

  • "How many OSPF routes does P2 have?"
  • "Can device P1 reach 100.65.255.14?"
  • "How many BGP sessions does P1 have?"
  • "Show interfaces down on P1"
  • "Get management IP address of P3"
  • "Ping 1.1.1.1 from P1's loopback"
  • "Traceroute 1.1.1.1 from P1's loopback"
  • "Healthcheck P1" (or "Healthcheck P1, P2", etc.)
  • "Device P2 looks weird... can you check it?"
  • Open-ended queries about network topics (try in 'general' mode).

Modes:
------
Normal Mode:
  - The default mode. ChatNOC connects to live devices and executes commands.
  - Type "exit" or "quit" to terminate ChatNOC.

Demo Mode:
  - To try a dry-run without live device connections, type:
        demo
  - In demo mode, pre-saved outputs from the "demo" folder are used.
  - The prompt will change to:
        demo-mode >
  - Available demo devices include:
        P1 to P8 (Cisco IOS),
        PE1-Junos (Juniper),
        PE2-IOSXR (Cisco IOS XR),
        PE3-Huawei (NE40E),
        PE4-Nokia (Nokia 7750 SR).
  - To return to normal mode, type:
        exit demo

General Mode:
  - For open-ended questions about networking topics (without executing device commands), type:
        general
  - In general mode, the prompt will change to:
        general-mode >
  - In this mode, ChatNOC uses an approved topics list (from baseline/index.yaml) to answer
    your questions. If your query is outside these topics, you’ll be asked to rephrase.
  - To see the list of approved topics, type:
        approved topics
  - To return to normal mode, type:
        exit general

General Commands:
-----------------
  help         - Displays this help message.
  demo         - Enter demo mode (dry-run with pre-saved outputs).
  general      - Enter general mode for open-ended networking topics.
  approved topics - Display the list of approved topics for general mode.
  exit demo    - Exit demo mode (returns to normal mode).
  exit general - Exit general mode (returns to normal mode).
  exit / quit  - In normal mode, terminates ChatNOC.

File & Folder Structure:
------------------------
  - Baseline Data:
        Stored in the "baseline" folder (e.g., baseline/healthcheck_baseline.yaml and baseline/index.yaml).
        Contains expected configurations and a list of approved topics.
        
  - Explanations:
        Each explanation scenario is stored in its own file under the "explanations" folder.
        This modular design makes maintenance and future enhancements easier.
        
  - Demo Outputs:
        Pre-saved command outputs for demo mode are stored in the "demo" folder.
        Each device has its own subfolder (e.g., demo/p1, demo/p2, etc.), and files are named based on the executed command
        (normalized by replacing spaces with underscores and lowercasing).

Troubleshooting:
----------------
  - **Device Connection Issues:**
        • Verify the device’s hostname/IP address, TCP port, and credentials.
        • Check that the device is powered on and that no firewall is blocking access.
        
  - **Ollama Errors:**
        • Confirm that Ollama is running and listening on the expected IP address and port.
        
  - **Demo Mode:**
        • Ensure that the appropriate demo output files exist in the "demo" folder.
        • If a file is missing or empty, ChatNOC will inform you.

  - **General Mode:**
        • If your query does not mention an approved networking topic, you’ll be asked to rephrase your question.
        • To see which topics are approved, type "approved topics".

Additional Notes:
-----------------
  - ChatNOC is designed to be flexible and modular. Future enhancements may include additional baseline types,
    more explanation scenarios, and further interactive features.
  - The system also handles profanity and nonsensical queries with light-hearted responses.
  - Your feedback is welcome as the project evolves!
