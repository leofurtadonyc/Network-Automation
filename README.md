# Network-Automation
This is a set of Python script utilities designed for network automation. They encompass simple yet useful tasks, providing an avenue for learning and experimenting with network automation using Python.

To prevent interference with your Python environment, ensure that you use it within a Python virtual environment. You can create one using the 'python3 -m venv name_environment' command, then activate it with 'source name_environment/bin/activate'. Alternatively, you may use Pipenv, Poetry, Conda, or any other tool you choose. Easy steps (on a Mac computer):

1. mkdir sandbox
2. cd sandbox
3. python3 -m venv network-automation-env
4. source network-automation-env/bin/activate
5. pip3 install --upgrade pip
6. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
