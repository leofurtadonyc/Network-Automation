                ============================================================
remarks:        The following is required from your organization in order to
                establish a BGP session with FAKE TELECOM at ASN AS64496:
                - The customer must use a RIR assigned ASN.
                - The customer must have a route/route6 object for each prefix
                it intends to announce to us, which might include its own
                prefixes and, if desired, its customers' prefixes as well (customer cone).
                - Each route/route6 object corresponding to a customer prefix
                (yours or a prefix from your customer cone) must inform the
                correct ASN in its 'origin' field.
                - The ASN mentioned in the 'origin' field of each route and route6
                object must have its proper and corresponding aut-num object.
                - The aforementioned aut-num objects must have a clear routing
                policy stating what as-sets are to be announced to us.
                - This as-set MUST be informed on PeeringDB ("IRR as-set/route-set")
remarks:        FAKE TELECOM strongly encourages you to use two simultaneous methods to
                validate the origin of the prefixes you announce to us: IRR and ROA
                (published in your RPKI regime). This is highly recommended because
                some of our direct upstreams and also indirect upstreams may reject
                any routes where there is a failure in the origin validation process.
remarks:        You can start this process by "cleaning up your own house first", then
                working directly with your customers so they can do their homework too,
                and, by doing that, we can all prevent route leaks and prefix hijacking
                from happening. :-)
remarks:        Last but not least, please feel free to contact us if you have any questions
                or need our assistance in working these best practices with you!
                We will definitely make ourselves available to increase the security of the
                Internet, your experience as our customer/partner, and in the best
                interest of our mutual agreement!
