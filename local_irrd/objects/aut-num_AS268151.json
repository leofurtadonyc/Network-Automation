This is highly recommended because\n                some of our direct upstreams and also indirect upstreams may reject\n                any routes where there is a failure in the origin validation process.\nremarks:        You can start this process by \"cleaning up your own house first\", then\n                working directly with your customers so they can do their homework too,\n                and, by doing that, we can all prevent route leaks and prefix hijacking\n                from happening. :-)\nremarks:        Last but not least, please feel free to contact us if you have any questions\n                or need our assistance in working these best practices with you!\n                We will definitely make ourselves available to increase the security of the\n                Internet, your experience as our customer/partner, and in the best\n                interest of our mutual agreement!\nmnt-by:         MAINT-AS268151\nsource:         IRRD",
